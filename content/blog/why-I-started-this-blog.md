I know what you are probably thinking: “Great...another tech blog.” It’s true, there are a ton of blogs about design, web development, programming, you name it. With so much existing content, why read mine? Well, I'll get to that, but first let me give you some background about myself.

## About Me

If you haven’t heard by now, my name is Jack Gannon. I’m a designer and developer from sunny Phoenix, Arizona. When I say sunny, I mean the kind of sunshine that’s hot enough to fry sidewalk-omelettes and melt unfortunate enough to be left outside for more than 10 minutes. Needless to say, I spent a lot of summer months indoors. Being the geek that I was (er...still am), naturally I gravitated towards computers.

Even though I consider myself geeky, I will be honest: I wasn’t a great student in my earlier years. I had a hard time paying attention in class, and despite having some amazing teachers, I felt that the traditional methods of teaching weren’t working for me. I had a very low self esteem when it came to my education.

## Learning How to Learn

It wasn’t until college that I discovered some alternative methods of learning. One such method is something called the Feynman Technique. To put it simply, you take an advanced concept, and, well... put it simply

Personally, I learn best by understanding the “big picture” first, and then retaining that knowledge through repetition and applying it to my projects. I invite you to learn whichever way works best for you.

Whether you are a seasoned designer looking for the best new plugin for your UI design tool, or someone who is just getting started learning web development, my goal is to provide you with information in the best format for your individual needs.
